# TLDR
This project is only for my personal coding practice and I don't think it will be useful for anyone elses.
# Background
This project was inspired by this [video](https://youtu.be/mOSirVeP5lo).

While I am quite familiar with the concept of ray-tracing - I created an algorithm for optimising caustics rendering as a part of my master degree's thesis (you can find it [here](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2006/13554/13554.pdf)), I have never had a chance to implement a full renderer using ray-tracing myself. Partly, because I was more interested in the interactive rendering techniques and ray-tracing tends to be the direct opposite of what I wanted.

However, in the recent years, the advancement of graphics hardwares have been progressed to the point that we can achieve this in real-time. Real-time ray-tracing has been widely adopted by many applications and games. I beleive it's about time for me to refresh my knowledge about ray-tracer and see what I can acheive from it.

# Objective
This project serves as my personal graphics programming practice. I have no clear result in mind and won't gurantee whether it will turn into something really useful . I will only update it when I have free time.

My first objective is to see whether I can make a faster renderer than that project in the YouTube video. Anything coming after depends on my whim.
